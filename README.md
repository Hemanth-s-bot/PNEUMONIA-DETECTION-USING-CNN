# PNEUMONIA-DETECTION-USING-CNN

Hello! Below is an outline of how I prepared the data, trained my models, and predicted bounding boxes for the project, For questions please contact me at icl16hemanths@gmail.com

# Directory structure
* data: contains raw and processed data from Kaggle
* model: Sequantial Convolution Neural Network model for training, i used many layers for processing
* gradio: Used for interative user interface

# Software
 * (python packages are detailed separately)
 * python
 * jupyter notebook
 * gradio
